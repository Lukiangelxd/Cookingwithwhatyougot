Cookin With What You Got

This is an application that will help you find delicious recipes using ingredients you already own in your home. The application will also give you nearby resturants for a fun night out or a quick take out option. There are three pages for the application. The Home page which contains an About Us, link to the Generator page, link to the Saved page and a Contact Us form. The Generator page will allow you to input up to 10 ingredients that you would like to include in a recipe, will allow you to pick between Breakfast, Dinner and a Snack, and will let you save any recipes you would like to make later. Then there is the Saved page where any recipes you chose to save from the Generator page with the save button will reside. 

For this application we chose to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bulma, jquery along with 2 API's.
