        <p>Hello! I'm Chris, one of the co-developers on this project. This project was exciting to work on as it allowed me to gain practical experience working with JavaScript, jQuery, and APIs in a team environment. I additionally gained a deeper understanding of working through GitHub feature branches and I look forward to continuing to put these skills to professional use.</p>

        <p>Hey I'm Hannah and in the first group project of the class our team has chosen to go with a recipe generator! I love this choice because I am a self taught baker at home with a tiny budget. My key positions in this group project is creating the wireframing of the webpage using photoshop, choosing a CSS framework and being the overall overseer of the project.</p>
