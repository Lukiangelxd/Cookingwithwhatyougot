        <p>Hello! I'm Chris, one of the co-developers on this project. This project was exciting to work on as it allowed me to gain practical experience working with JavaScript, jQuery, and APIs in a team environment. I additionally gained a deeper understanding of working through GitHub feature branches and I look forward to continuing to put these skills to professional use.</p>

        <!--Hannah needs info-->
        <p>Hey I'm Hannah and in the first group project of the class our team has chosen to go with a recipe generator! I love this choice because I am a self taught baker at home with a tiny budget. My key positions in this group project is creating the wireframing of the webpage using photoshop, choosing a CSS framework and being the overall overseer of the project.</p>

        <p>Greetings! I'm Wren, one of the three developers working on this project. This was an exciting first project working with others. It has allowed me to further improve my skills using HTML, CSS, GitBash and GitHub along with teaching Bulma and working in an group setting.</p>
