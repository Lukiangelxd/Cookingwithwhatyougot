        <p>Hello! I'm Chris, one of the co-developers on this project. This project was exciting to work on as it allowed me to gain practical experience working with JavaScript, jQuery, and APIs in a team environment. I additionally gained a deeper understanding of working through GitHub feature branches and I look forward to continuing to put these skills to professional use.</p>
